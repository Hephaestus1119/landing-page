# landing-page
This is a project that involves using flex-box to make a presentable website template. It can be used to demonstrate information as well as link to other valuable pages. This project was used to practice flex-box and css as well as html from scratch. Some challenges were getting the button sizing correct as well as understanding the padding used for the spacing around each element.
